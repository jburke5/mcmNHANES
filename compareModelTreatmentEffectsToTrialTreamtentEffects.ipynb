    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b> Random Error</b> - Certainly possible as a contributor as the trial-based estimates have considerable uncertaintly, but the magnitude of the differnce is too great to entirely put on random error.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b> Sample Selection</b> — The main difference comparing our synthetic trial popuation to the actual trials is that the BPs are slightly higher in our sample (by about 3/3 points). Given that ASCVD includes a sbp-sbp quadratic term and a sbp-age interaction, its possible that this is driving part of the story.\n",
    "        <p>In response, I tried 3 things:\n",
    "        <p><ol>\n",
    "            <li>Lowering the BPs for all patients in the sample by 3 points and re-running. This had a tiny effect on the relative risks (<i>both increasing to 0.72</i>). So no big effect.</li>\n",
    "            <li>Turning off the quadratic and interaction effects. Maybe the problem isn't the mean BPs but, the presence of extreme high BPs in our sample compared to the trials (which is hard to assess, becasue the trials only report means).<i>Turning off the quadratic and interaction effects increaes the effect sizes to 0.73></i></li>\n",
    "            <li>The other thought here woudl be about <b>race.</b> 16% of the simulated sample is Black. I'm not sure what that looks like in teh pooled analysis. But, given that race features heavily in ASCVD, its a conceivable problem. Turning off all race effects led to an effect of <i>0.74</i> for stroke and no change for MI, <i>0.71</i></li><p>\n",
    "        <li>Turning off all of those effects change the RR to <i>0.73</i> for stroke and no change for MI, <i>0.71</i> - so race seems like its probably the most important seleectkon factor and may be drivin the other factors...but, on teh whole selection factors (that aren't of the form \"Peopel in trials have better outcomes\") dont' seem to explain much of the gap</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "        </ol>  \n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><b> Measurement Error</b> — While always a condern with BPs, I have a hard time seeing how it would drive our findings here. First, the measurements from trials are (presumably) decent. Second, there is a fair bit of data supporting the BP lowering effect — those estimates should be fairly precise and both random error and non-differential measurement error shoudl balance out do to sample size. Third, if anything, the trial-measured BP lowering effect seems pretty small — and yet we're still over-estimating the BP lowering effect.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b> Heterogeneity of BP lowering? </b> — If it were that patients with very high blood pressures had a larger effect to a single BP med, then we might miss the boat by giving everybody a fixed 5/3 BP reduction. However, without having anything to parameterize this off...its hard to do anything more than just to explore it.\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Didn't build a model in whom BP lowering occurs (don't think we know...), but drew BP lowering from a distribution - possibly a very small effect: stroke RR <i>0.72</i>, MI: <i>0.71</i></li></ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Confounding in ASCVD</b> — This seems most plausible to me. It seems pretty believale that patients with very high BPs also have other factors that drive their long-term risk that aren't well measured. So, the idea that ASCVD over-estimates the effect of BP lowring at high BPs is plausible. Unless we could account for that confouder (any papers on ASCVD and SES?), I thikn this means that we have to put in a recalibration factor to try and get our estimates to line up.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Inaccurate trial estimation of treatment effect</b> — Well, if that's the case, we're screwed. We need the trials for treatment effect. I guess its possible — the trial population may be healthier than the ASCVD population, for example, and perhaps there is some sort of ceiling effect. But, that seems unlikely given that the predicted risk in the trials lines up almost perfectly with ASCVD</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Period effects</b> — Doesn’t make a ton of sense though…those are probably leading to lower RRs over time and the trials, based on older data (right?) have less BP effect than the cohorts.</li>\n",
